# maplesyrup

The reason I decided to go for a fork, is because there is no
point in recreating something AS simple as a notes app. Plus,
dcode does the job well anyways. Credits belong to him.

I add additional features and a prettier UI for everyone to use.
Feel free to fork this project if you want to!

This is the first project that I have made.
Think to yourself, are you giving yourself permission?

Ever thought of going out of the norm, and just using a notes app that looks nice and has minimal fluff?
Yeah, me too.

Maples is an attempt to pull this thing off while safeguarding your privacy to the fullest.

It does NOT have 456 new features or 30+ ways to edit your text.

It's just that simplistic and easy to navigate.


This is still a work in progress, but it will soon be out there.
Stay tuned.

-K.
