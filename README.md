The reason I decided to go for a fork, is because there is no
point in recreating something AS simple as a notes app. Plus,
dcode does the job well anyways. Credits belong to him.

I add additional features and a prettier UI for everyone to use.
Feel free to fork this project if you want to!

This is the first project that I have made.
Think to yourself, are you giving yourself permission?
